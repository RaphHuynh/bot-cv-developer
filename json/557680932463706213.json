           "description": "My name is Jascha (Th\u00e9ophile) DOLINSKY MERLE and I'm a 20 year old passionate computer scientist who loves to be a big help to any community. They jokingly call me the chief Swift officer or the chief .NET officer around town. Those are the languages I tend to nerd out the most on and do a majority of my projects in. I'm also a JVM language, Python, Ruby, Rust and Go and modern syntax in general enthusiast and one of the rare C++ enjoyers on this planet and my frameworks of choice are Vue and Svelte. Carbon is my most anticipated language. I very occasionally do some C code as well as some JS/TS and PHP. I also know other more obscure languages including quite a number of esoteric ones and niche ones. I daily drive IntelliJ-based IDEs. I am a chess enjoyer and a pretty strong competitive super smash brothers player. I like games, I like traveling and food and meeting people the world over. I have a pretty positive outlook on life and making it better for everyone on this blue planet is my life's mission.",
